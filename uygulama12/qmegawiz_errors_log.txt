MegaWizard Plug-In Manager will rename the variation to "altfp_mula" to prevent compilation errors

Apr 03 10AM:26:51>: The following design file, which has identical name but a different extension 
from the specified variation file, already exists in the working directory:

altfp_mula.vhd

This may create a conflict of design files and/or lead to undesirable side
effects.

Is it OK to continue file generation?
